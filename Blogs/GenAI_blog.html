          <p class="blog-post-meta">Nov 29, 2023 by <a href="../index.html">Yasin</a></p>

          <p>In the realm of technological advancements, few innovations hold as much transformative potential as Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). What does it hold for the world? How do we evolve from here?</p>
          <img src="../Assets/Images/Gen AI.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Gen AI">
          <hr>
          <p>This cutting-edge field, a subset of artificial intelligence, is not just about understanding or processing information but about creating it. From text to images, music to synthetic voices, Generative AI is redefining the boundaries of machine capability, ushering in a new era where machines don't just learn but also innovate.</p>
          <h2>How did it all begin?</h2>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p>"A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human".</p>
            <p><em>- Alan Turing: 1912-1954</em></p>

          </blockquote>
          <p>The origins of Generative AI can be traced back to the early days of artificial intelligence in the mid-20th century. Pioneers like Alan Turing laid the groundwork with theories that questioned the possibility of machines thinking and creating.</p> 
          <p>The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw the first practical experiments in AI, focusing on pattern recognition and basic generative capabilities. These early models were rudimentary but set the stage for more complex developments.</p>
          <h3>Small steps on the path</h3>
          <p>All the advances in AI are rooted in the same fundamental principle: the ability to create new and exciting ways of understanding and understanding. Each step on the way was a step towards the goal of  achieving superintelligence.</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Machine Learning Breakthroughs:</dt>
            <dd>The adoption of machine learning techniques, especially deep learning, neural networks marked significant advancements.</dd>
            <dt>Impact of Big Data:</dt>
            <dd>The explosion of data in the digital age fueled AI's learning capabilities, allowing for more sophisticated generative models.</dd>
            <dt>Advent of GANs:</dt>
            <dd>Perhaps the most pivotal moment in the history of Generative AI was the introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">2014</a>.</dd>

          <h2>Rise of LLMs</h2>
          <p>Large Language Models like OpenAI's GPT represented a major leap in natural language generation using GANs.</p>

          <pre><code>/ChatGPT/</code></pre>
          <p>The fastest adoption of any tool in the history, ChatGPT was released in 2022. In mere 2 months, 100 million MAUs were gained. Whereas it took Uber 70 months to reach the same feat. With this, many leading players in the tech world had to push out their own LLMs. Below are some of the most popular ones in comparison</p>
